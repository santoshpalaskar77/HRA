## Installation Requirements
- It is recommended to create a conda environment with the following:
  - `Python 3.9.12`
  - The necessary Python packages can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file using,
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Instructions for Running Code
- Simulated data is generated in the simulated.py file itself.
- Other datasets (Labour, Tourism, Wiki) are in the "datasets" folder
- Except for the lag-llama model, other models can be run using .sh files from the "scripts" folder.
- To run the lag-llama models, we have defined a .ipynb file for each dataset
